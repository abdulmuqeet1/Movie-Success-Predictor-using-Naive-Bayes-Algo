    <h1>Movie Success Predictor System</h1>
    <p>Machine learning algorithm used to predict about the success of the movie based on the cast selected for movie


In the age of data, every industry is making their decision based on their
data.Data Driven decision are made which are based on the patterns in past data
In strategy making these pattern and data insight can also help to make a strategy which will help them in better making better decision and startegies

The application of machine larning model can be seen in every industry, from Stock Exchange market to Finance Departments,
from marketing to military tactics, from tech industry to bio engineering it can seen every where.
But in the field of TV and film industry the implementation of machine learning is pretty low.

The common problem directors and other stake olders face is selection of stars and co-stars
which will lead to success of movie. Though it's a difficult task but because you never know what will happen(weather it get hit or not)
but data driven decision can help in making selection which can increase the chances of success of movie.</p>
